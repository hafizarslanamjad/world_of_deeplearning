\section{Mathematical and Logical Basis of Subtraction}
Subtraction is defined as a binary operation that measures the difference between two quantities. Formally, given two scalars $A$ and $B$, the expression $A - B$ indicates the amount by which $A$ exceeds $B$, or the directional shift from $B$ to $A$. This operation inherently provides a three-way logical categorization:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $A - B > 0$: Positive change
	\item $A - B = 0$: No change
	\item $A - B < 0$: Negative change
\end{itemize}

This categorization underpins the logical use of subtraction in systems where change, deviation, or novelty must be identified. It transforms a passive comparison into an actionable, direction-sensitive insight.
