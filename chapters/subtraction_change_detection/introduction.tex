\section{Introduction}
Change detection lies at the core of numerous computational and cognitive tasks, spanning domains such as image processing, time-series forecasting, and symbolic reasoning. One of the most foundational yet powerful operations used to detect change is subtraction: the expression $A - B$. In this chapter, we present a logically structured argument for why subtraction serves as an effective and universal indicator of change. We investigate this idea from temporal, visual, and geometric perspectives, showing how this simple operation captures both magnitude and direction of change.
