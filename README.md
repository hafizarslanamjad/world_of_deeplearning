# Deep Learning Foundations ‚Äì A LaTeX Book

This repository contains the LaTeX source files for my book on **deep learning foundations**.  
The book is written to bridge the gap between **theory** and **practice** for students, researchers, and developers who want to deeply understand the concepts that power modern AI systems.

## üìñ What the Book Covers
- Fundamental **theoretical concepts** that underpin deep learning models
- Step-by-step reasoning that explains *why* algorithms and architectures work
- Practical **Computer Vision** projects (e.g., image classification, anomaly detection, object recognition)
- Practical **Natural Language Processing** projects (e.g., sentiment analysis, embeddings, sequence models)

## üéØ Goal
Most deep learning tutorials focus either only on code or only on theory.  
This book combines both: it explains the *mathematical reasoning* behind the methods **and** demonstrates how these ideas are implemented in code.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use
- The book is written in **LaTeX** (compiled using TeXstudio).  
- To build the PDF, clone the repository and run:
  ```bash
  pdflatex main.tex
